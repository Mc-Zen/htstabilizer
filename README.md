# Short Quantum Circuits Python library

This library provides hardware-tailored quantum Clifford circuits for stabilizer state preparation or readout as well as mutually unbiased bases in order to perform efficient full-state tomography on small qubit systems. 

## Installation

The library can be easily installed from [PyPi][pypi-page]:
```
pip install shortcircuits
```

## Usage

```
from shortcircuits import stabilizer
...
```
